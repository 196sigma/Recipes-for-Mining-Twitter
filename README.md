# Overview

This repository contains code for the [21 Recipes for Mining Twitter](http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920018261) (O'Reilly, 2011.) As the name of the title suggests, it's a short cookbook of recipes that's designed to help you solve common problems when working with Twitter data. Some of the recipes are extracted from content presented in [Mining the Social Web](http://amzn.to/d1Ci8A) while others are completely new additions. In either case, they're designed to be bite-sized and serve as the jetpack that you can strap onto that great Twitter mining idea you've been noodling on -- whether it's as simple as running some disposible scripts to crunch some numbers or as extensive as creating full-blown interactive web application.
